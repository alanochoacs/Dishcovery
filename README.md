# Dishcovery
Dishcovery is an application that allows users to explore countries and their well known foods. The system stores information about countries, dishes, and dish categories. Users can browse dishes, search for dishes, and filter by country or category. There are no user roles or login requirements; the application is designed for public browsing.

## Steps to Run locally

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start the server: `npm start`

### Node.js Files

**`package.json`** – This file lists your project’s info, dependencies, and npm (Node.js) scripts.
**`package-lock.json`** - From what I read online, this file locks dependency versions to ensure consistent installs across machines. Do not manually edit it; it is automatically generated by npm (Node.js).
